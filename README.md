Troy is an implementation of the Pilot API, as defined in the P* Pilot model.
That model describes pilot job like systems (though not limited to compute
jobs).  The semantic functionality of Troy is provided by adaptors, which
interface to different pilot backends.  Additionally, Troy facilitates the
application level scheduling of work units on the respective pilot frameworks.
