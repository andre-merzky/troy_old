Troy is an implementation of the Pilot API, as defined in the P* Pilot model.
That model describes pilot job like systems (not limited to compute jobs).  The
semantic functionality of Troy is provided by adaptors, which interface to
different pilot backends (or components).  

Please refer to the Troy wiki for installation instructions, user guide, etc:
