Why does compute_pilot not have a list_cus() call?  How else do I find out what
CU runs on a specific pilot?  Same for cps.list_cus.  So, how can the scheduler
to any sensible co-location, for example?

There is no compute_data_pilot_service, and no compute_data_pilot -- so there
also cannot be a scheduler on that level.  We can only have a data-compute
scheduler on unit service level, which then operates on data_pilot_services and
compute_pilot_services.  Not sure if that is sufficient...

Expose adaptor via object inspection.
