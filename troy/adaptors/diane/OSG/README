This assumes you have access to a OSG submit node, have a working X509 proxy,
etc.

Scenario 1: To run a DIANE master on the OSG submit host (Renci)
================================================================

Install DIANE
-------------
mkdir ~/diane
cd ~/diane
wget http://cern.ch/diane/packages/diane-install
python diane-install 2.4
$(~/diane/install/2.4/bin/diane-env)

Get the CondorSubmitter.py from
https://github.com/saga-project/troy/tree/master/troy/adaptors/diane/OSG
and copy it to ~/diane/submitters.

Create a hello world script and runfile as per the DIANE tutorial:
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/ArdaGrid/DIANETutorial

Start the master:
$ diane-run hello.run

And in another window, start the worker:
$ diane-submitter Condor

After some time, the worker should start processing tasks from the master.


Scenario 2: To run a DIANE master somewhere and submit remotely to OSG
======================================================================

(This scenario requires a ganga installation on the remote node, the 
steps in Scenario 1 should suffice for that.)

Install DIANE
-------------
mkdir ~/diane
cd ~/diane
wget http://cern.ch/diane/packages/diane-install
python diane-install 2.4
$(~/diane/install/2.4/bin/diane-env)

Get the EngageSubmitter.py from
https://github.com/saga-project/troy/tree/master/troy/adaptors/diane/OSG
and copy it to ~/diane/submitters.

Create a hello world script and runfile as per the DIANE tutorial:
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/ArdaGrid/DIANETutorial

Start the master:
$ diane-run hello.run

And in another window, start the worker, using something similar as the
convenience script "remote_ganga.sh".

After some time, the worker should start processing tasks from the master.


General
=======

Jobs are submitted through Ganga. Ganga gets installed through DIANE.
You can use "ganga" to monitor your jobs progress.
More information can be viewed at:
~/gangadir/workspace/$USER/LocalXML/$JOBID
You will find here files with stderr, stdout, etc.
